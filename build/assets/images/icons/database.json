I know, what a morbid topic for a young adult at his physical peak with a potentially prosperous career and life ahead of him to preoccupy his waking thoughts with. &ldquo;Why are you thinking about death? You still have life ahead of you. You go to MIT, you have a loving family, you&rsquo;re good-looking, you&rsquo;re most likely going to be rich! You live the life of the one percent.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I acknowledge and appreciate my privileged position, but a lot of people seem to be missing the point. Moreover, the more time I&rsquo;ve devoted to pondering said point, the more I&rsquo;ve become disillusioned and disheartened by the civilization into which I was born, and as this think piece unfolds, I hope at a minimum to help you understand my grievances, if not to persuade you towards similar outlooks. I am I suicidal? No. On the contrary, I love life, and it&rsquo;s this interminable love that gave rise to my fear of death and ignited the onset of existential thoughts that become the basis for what I will share in this think piece."

But nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve felt the urge to translate the mental dialogue I&rsquo;ve had since I left high school into a physical record, if not for the purpose of starting a conversation, then for therapeutic exercise inherent in the process. &ldquo;But what is this think piece about?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had trouble articulating this to my peers recently, but if I had to give a one-line summary, it would best be summarized as an attempt at constructing a model of physical reality and a proposal for steering humanity towards some best-case utopian future. This is a bold and somewhat arrogant undertaking; this I understand. But barring billionaire <Link src={'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7N-9E_e-wk'}>Elon Musk</Link>, I see few denizens of our planet actively attempting to deter humanity from precipitating its imminent self-inflicted extinction. I just want to make my contribution using the means I currently have — my knowledge of the current and prospective technological landscape and my voice. But before getting to the heart of the matter, I&rsquo;m going to dial back a bit and give you some context on human civilization and present how our history and biological evolution has lead to our present-day society. We often overlook these details or classify them as fixed conditions, but I want to convince you otherwise."

I bring this point up to highlight the fact that such a goal might take forever to achieve, especially through a partially stochastic (randomized) process such as evolution. As a result, we have reason to believe the <Italic>homo sapien</Italic> in its current form is in no way an optimal design. Furthermore, as a consequence of the emergence of consciousness, humans have developed their own set of desires that weren&rsquo;t initially factored into the original objective function set by nature — desires such as love, esteem, and self-actualization. For this reason, humans today are the product of an objective function that by our present standards is underspecified. Indeed, an objective function built on survival is not suitable for satisfying the needs of a 21st century human. This is a problem; we need to reconcile our objective function with our higher-level needs."

Because these groups remained relatively small in size, resource distribution was never an issue. It was only once we made the transition to settled civilization, agriculture, and animal domestication did we need to develop some form of economics to manage this distribution process. In addition, as these groups slowly grew, specialization of skill and exchange of resources resulted in higher yields and overall efficiency.

Another significant benefit of representative money was that an exchange for one resource yielded a versatile return, so cases where one party didn&rsquo;t desire the resource owned by the other party would be evaded.

Where a concept such as &ldquo;owning&rdquo; exists, concepts such as &ldquo;loss&rdquo; and &ldquo;theft&rdquo; exist too. This is the basis on which theft is built. If one owned property and it wasn&rsquo;t acquired by a second party through mutually-consented conditions, their property was by definition stolen. I highlight this to show that loss and theft are consequences of ownership, and as a result cannot exist without it.

Digital documents also offer mutability; it&rsquo;s a lot easier to modify digital text as opposed to physical text. Finally, digital information is a lot easier and faster to retrieve and send through space. As long as a computer is connected to the internet, a user has the ability to access what is essentially humanity&rsquo;s aggregated knowledge repository and has the ability to send information across the world at the speed of light, as an upper limit of course. There is no need to spend resources on printing books and the waiting time for acquiring the information is negligible. Not to mention all this can be done while in the comfort of your own home. If I must be honest, I find it amazing that we haven&rsquo;t made a complete shift to digital information yet."

I&rsquo;m going to mention two more drawbacks to language as a form of information transfer. The first additional drawback is that the latency of transfer of information from the encoder to the decoder is fairly high. When an information source develops mental contents they want to communicate, the source must first convert those contents into an equivalent message in spoken language. Often this process takes time because there is no one-to-one mapping from a thought to a sentence. This results in many sentences with similar semantic meaning but varying degrees of information loss. Consequently, the encoder needs to perform a quick heuristic search for the translation with the least error. Additionally, humans are better at recognition than recall, so they might spend time attempting to recall words that would better minimize information loss further exacerbating the delay process. Once a message has been successfully encoded by the source into spoken language there is the latency between information dispatch (by the encoder) and information acquisition (by the decoder), namely the time it takes to verbally communicate the message. Finally, once the entire message has been heard by the decoder, it must be converted from spoken language back into mental contents before the information is truly acquired, which similar to the encoding conversion is susceptible to information loss due to language ambiguity. While the second additional drawback varies in magnitude between different languages, all are burdened by it to some extent. This drawback is <Italic>throughput</Italic>. As explained above, throughput is the amount of units of information a system can process in a given amount of time. For most languages, the unit is a word (or to be more specific a <Italic>morpheme</Italic>); for other languages such as Chinese, they use characters, which often represent more information per character compared to those in other languages. As a result, Chinese would have higher information throughput than English. But even so, the benefits of a higher throughput are often counteracted by the effort needed to memorize several thousand ideographs and the sets of ideas they can represent."

You type out a message on your smartphone by tapping letters on its touchscreen to form words to form sentences at a maximum rate of two thumb taps at any given moment. Let&rsquo;s assume it takes you about ten seconds to type and send your message. There was a ten second latency in information transfer caused by the output channel of finger actuation. If you think about it, all our input channels into computational devices work in the same way: feeding button presses, clicks, and taps into computational devices or manipulating the spatial position of a computational input device in physical space to move the spatial position of a coupled digital object in digital space.

Reading as a process makes use of the eyes, our highest bandwidth interface to the physical world. Light reflected from paper enters our eyes and hits their retinas where the light signals are converted to neural signals that are interpreted by the brain. The order and spatial relation of the symbols are then interpreted to perceive language, which is finally converted into mental contents.

Human&rsquo;s overcame this dilemma initially by storing information in books in the form of written language, but with the dawn of the Information Age information began to be stored digitally on computers.

Information is crucial for advancing society because it increases the likelihood of technological advances which by definition improve our living conditions by helping us satisfy more needs in more efficient manners."

          "data" : "The brain-computer interface would provide a better solution to both dilemmas. In the case of the <Italic>information transfer dilemma</Italic>, information would be transmitted almost instantaneously. The brain-computer interface would essentially give our brains a direct connection to the internet, allowing us to use its transfer speeds to send mental contents from one brain to any other interface — another brain, the internet or some computational device. In the case of the <Italic>information persistence dilemma</Italic>, information is persisted like all other digital data in 2017 — on the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;. Essentially, mental contents, or thoughts if you will, would be uploaded and saved on remote servers much like any other form of digital data is today. As mentioned, this would be advantageous because digital information is space efficient, resistant to atrophy, mutable-friendly, and has lower transfer latency. You may recognize that storing information in books offered similar benefits, so you might wonder why this is a better solution. Simply put, with all one&rsquo;s mental contents saved on the cloud, one would essentially have a memory extension that they can use to upload and download &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s brain. This relationship is similar to how one might download digital information from the cloud onto their physical computer&rsquo;s hard disk. Additionally, one isn&rsquo;t limited to accessing their information alone; they&rsquo;d be able to acquire any and all information from the internet. The implications of these two improvements means that humans would be able to speak to each other instantly and free of subjectivity due to minimized information loss caused by translation error inherent in language. Communication could be more rich too; emotions and mental states could be shared. Furthermore, all humans would be able to acquire all known knowledge instantaneously. Gone are the days of spending the best years of your life acquiring knowledge at learning institutions; no longer would millions of humans spend years of their life re-deriving common knowledge. As a result, the Information Ecosystem would comprise solely of mental contents, because all physical transactive memory would become digital transactive memory, which by virtue of every human&rsquo;s connection to the internet would become mental contents. I hope by now you&rsquo;re starting to see where I&rsquo;m getting at."

If you recall, at the beginning of this think piece I made an analogy where I anthropomorphized nature as a designer that continually iterates on and refines organisms that best maximize its objective function, survival, through time with the hopes of eventually converging onto some optimal design. What such an intervention would do is simply delegate control of this iterative process to humans and allow us to perform it over shorter timescales. Recall that humans today are in no way an optimal design. Another benefit that comes with taking control of this iterative process is that we will now be able to reconcile nature&rsquo;s original objective function with our higher-level needs: love, esteem, and self-actualization. Thus, collectively we will be closer to achieving self-actualization and every need below it on the Hierarchy of Needs."

The only issue: humans still have to devote time to collecting and producing the resources to sustain these needs. It might not be all of us, but there are a sizable group of people still invested in this business. Enter automation: we have created robots and machines that are far better than us at performing routine tasks, work at faster rates than us, and are not afflicted with the need to rest, so they can work night and day. These robots represent a threat to the jobs of many denizens, but they also offer the opportunity for humanity to be liberated from the need to occupy our time fulfilling these basic needs.

We have been entrenched in a capitalist society for quite some time now, and our minds have been conditioned to this societal system. In fact, the brain-computer interface might even be an easier problem given it is purely technical, while the post-scarcity problem involves imperfect entities. The vision might seem overly ambitious, but isolated areas of society already function in this way: libraries are governed by a culture of shared resources used on-demand — the same can be said of the internet.

A lot of today's youth make use of the Internet as a medium of communication and information retrieval; because so many people are connected to the internet, I believe it can be used as an effective way disseminate information. As a user of the Internet, its problem lies in the fact that it is so vast, which makes it difficult to acquire concise and relevant information. What I propose is an all-in-one website dedicated to technology with relevance to South Africa – a page where young people can visit to learn about the latest technologies and how they can improve our standards of living, to read inspirational stories about people our age performing great feats, to be exposed to interesting websites and hobbyist projects (such as the <Link src={'http://arduino.cc/'}>Arduino</Link>), and get a sense of where the technological world is heading. The website has to take advantage of other social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, to get people talking and to connect more people to the page.

Similarly, because they've lost interest in the subjects, they tend to find the work difficult because they don't have an interest in applying themselves to it. With this website I want to re-brand mathematics and sciences to the youth as tools with which they can reshape our landscape. The key lies in the fact that I will attempt to make it more palatable for the masses, so that any person somewhat interested in the information can understand it.

The teaching methods at schools and universities are very theoretically based, so students hardly get practical experience until later in their studies. I've noticed the consequences of this at the University of Cape Town this year, where I've seen that very few people who have chosen engineering as a profession have been exposed to actual electronics, and consequently find it difficult to cope with it, as a subject. Furthermore, I've noted many people who have chosen engineering as a profession, realize only late into their studies that they don't enjoy it because they had never been exposed to it, in their lives, before. These people often leave engineering to rather apply their analytical skills in business management roles. The converse might also happen, where people who have never been exposed to engineering possibly could have enjoyed it and even excelled in the discipline, but never had the chance to because they were not exposed to it."

The beauty of these platforms is that they allow people to create a range of amazing products, but require a solid foundation in mathematics to create the really &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo; products.

To resolve this, I could film the workshops and broadcast them on the previously proposed website with a list of the items needed to complete projects. Through this, more people will be exposed to true engineering – which might encourage people to engage in mathematics and science – assisted to cultivate the relevant skills, and helped to make more informed decisions about choosing engineering as a potential profession.

The exchange programs could help to expose more students and lecturers to the methods of teaching used elsewhere to help improve the methods we currently use here. The foundation could possibly be involved with Eskom, particularly in its Expo for Young Scientists, where it could identify new talent and help guide them. By going to MIT, I will also be opening up networking possibilities for both students and lecturers alike in South Africa; from these, I could possibly facilitate in organizing mentorship opportunities between scholars from there and from our universities. This foundation could visit different schools and conduct talks directed at the younger grades, such as Grade 9, and expose them to the &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; field of engineering.

Through providing many avenues with which to practically apply knowledge, the initiatives will develop creative minds and aid in producing qualified engineers. Having more engineers who are passionate about creating will not only boosts our manufacturing sector, but will potentially expedite solutions to South Africa's and the African continent's biggest problems, through the use of technology. As a bonus, it is likely more people will open up their own businesses – &ldquo;start-ups&rdquo; – to market their new ideas, which could aid in alleviating our poverty problem. I believe that through these tactical strategies, South Africa will be well on its way to becoming a producer as opposed to just being the consumer, and will be in a better position to solving its current economic and social problems."

Over the last couple of years however, we have seen a proliferation of frameworks written in JavaScript, which as a result has become the de facto language of the web. Because HTML and JavaScript developed independently, most frameworks have found different ways to marry the two. One of those ways is by incorporating JavaScript into HTML markup.

I know that sounds rather vague, but in practice, the decision becomes reasonably intuitive. &ldquo;But what if a given component's behavior relies on the state of another component?&rdquo; React deals with this by allowing components to share state through immutable properties called Props (passed properties). If you imagine your application as a tree structure, components higher in the tree (parent components) can pass down their state variables and methods to child components. However, the reverse is not true due to React's unidirectional data flow. As a result, data is passed down and events are triggered up through event handlers."

The parent component would keep track of the state of the switch (this.switchPressed), i.e. whether it is pressed or not. This state would be passed down to both child elements as props – the light switch would, in addition to the state, receive a toggle method (this.toggleSwitch) to mutate the value of the App state variable when the switch is clicked. This method would be tied to the switch as an event handler and respond to any click events on the light switch. As a result, when a user clicks the switch (an event), the this.props.toggleSwitch() method would be called by the event handler. This is an example of events triggering up the application. The method would then be invoked, toggling the switch state from &ldquo;off&rdquo; (false) to &ldquo;on&rdquo; (true), which in turn would be passed down to both child elements. The lightbulb would act on this new state by automatically re-rendering to the &ldquo;light on&rdquo; state, while the switch would act by automatically re-rendering to the &ldquo;pressed in&rdquo; state.

As per tradition, membership is limited to 10 matrics elected at the end of their Grade 11 year and it is comprised of the top 5 academics and 5 elected academics from that year, voted in by the outgoing Ten Club Members. Boys elected to the Ten Club are expected to present for 30 minutes on a topic of their choice. This encourages significant research and development that is crucial to life in the academic world. Boys in this society are granted a maroon tie with gold crosses on it (representing the Roman numeral 10) with the letters &ldquo;TC&rdquo; incorporated into it.",
