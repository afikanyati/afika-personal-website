As a result, my research led me to the use of a luminescent color palette as a means of creating this separability. Luminescent color does not exist in nature, thus there would be no  color blending. Furthermore, because these elements were to be constituents of a greater interface, my goal was to create a result devoid of ornamentation; consequently the user interface elements were composed merely of curvilinear forms. Lastly, although our goal was to maintain separability of physical and digital assets, we still strived for there to be a sense of unity between the two. As a consequence, the negative space of the buttons was transparent; this would allow the physical world to be visible from under the digital interface, thus aiding in a symbiotic union. The only constraint prescribed by my supervisor was to implement the user interface using <Italic text={'HTML'} /> and <Italic text={'CSS'} /> solely. The rationale behind this was to create a lightweight interface that would not obstruct from the user experience. The results of my efforts are the library of user interface elements below:"

In addition to this design choice, there were numerous other design considerations that had to be made owing to the three-dimensional nature of the application. Unlike two-dimensional applications, there was no bounding box or delineated working area in which we were constrained to develop; the entirety of three-dimensional space was our canvas, thus we had to find the best methods with which to organize information and help bridge the gap bridge the gap between users' working knowledge of 2D interface interactions and their three-dimensional counterparts."

I bring this point up to highlight the fact that such a goal might take forever to achieve, especially through a partially stochastic (randomized) process such as evolution. As a result, we have reason to believe the <Italic text={'homo sapien'} /> in its current form is in no way an optimal design. Furthermore, as a consequence of the emergence of consciousness, humans have developed their own set of desires that weren't initially factored into the original objective function set by nature — desires such as love, esteem, and self-actualization. For this reason, humans today are the product of an objective function that by our present standards is underspecified. Indeed, an objective function built on survival is not suitable for satisfying the needs of a 21st century human. This is a problem; we need to reconcile our objective function with our higher-level needs."

In space, the dissemination potential of information was governed by the size of the union set comprised of all the unique humans involved in a recursive traversal of an information source's human network. In simpler terms, the information known by all the humans in the information source's network, aggregated with all the humans in these humans' networks, ad infinitum. For the most part, this was geography-limited, so information became geographically-trapped. In time, information could not be transferred from the dead to the living, and as a result the likelihood of successful information transfers was highest during the living moments of the information source.

Because these groups remained relatively small in size, resource distribution was never an issue. It was only once we made the transition to settled civilization, agriculture, and animal domestication did we need to develop some form of economics to manage this distribution process. In addition, as these groups slowly grew, specialization of skill and exchange of resources resulted in higher yields and overall efficiency.

Another significant benefit of representative money was that an exchange for one resource yielded a versatile return, so cases where one party didn't desire the resource owned by the other party would be evaded.

A consequence of such a society was the concept of ownership. Because resources were traded for other resources, naturally this resulted in a society that advocated and perpetuated ownership of property over the sharing of resources. Where a concept such as \"owning\" exists, concepts such as \"loss\" and \"theft\" exist too. This is the basis on which theft is built. If one owned property and it wasn't acquired by a second party through mutually-consented conditions, their property was by definition stolen. I highlight this to show that loss and theft are consequences of ownership, and as a result cannot exist without it. But ownership is a by-product of scarcity, therefore it must follow that there is no such thing as loss or theft without scarcity. \"But there's no way you can eliminate scarcity\".

I'm going to mention two more drawbacks to language as a form of information transfer. The first additional drawback is that the latency of transfer of information from the encoder to the decoder is fairly high. When an information source develops mental contents they want to communicate, the source must first convert those contents into an equivalent message in spoken language. Often this process takes time because there is no one-to-one mapping from a thought to a sentence. This results in many sentences with similar semantic meaning but varying degrees of information loss. Consequently, the encoder needs to perform a quick heuristic search for the translation with the least error. Additionally, humans are better at recognition than recall, so they might spend time attempting to recall words that would better minimize information loss further exacerbating the delay process. Once a message has been successfully encoded by the source into spoken language there is the latency between information dispatch (by the encoder) and information acquisition (by the decoder), namely the time it takes to verbally communicate the message. Finally, once the entire message has been heard by the decoder, it must be converted from spoken language back into mental contents before the information is truly acquired, which similar to the encoding conversion is susceptible to information loss due to language ambiguity. While the second additional drawback varies in magnitude between different languages, all are burdened by it to some extent. This drawback is <Italic text={'throughput'} />. As explained above, throughput is the amount of units of information a system can process in a given amount of time. For most languages, the unit is a word (or to be more specific a <Italic text={'morpheme'} />); for other languages such as Chinese, they use characters, which often represent more information per character compared to those in other languages. As a result, Chinese would have higher information throughput than English. But even so, the benefits of a higher throughput are often counteracted by the effort needed to memorize several thousand ideographs and the sets of ideas they can represent."

Let's assume it takes you about ten seconds to type and send your message. There was a ten second latency in information transfer caused by the output channel of finger actuation. If you think about it, all our input channels into computational devices work in the same way: feeding button presses, clicks, and taps into computational devices or manipulating the spatial position of a computational input device in physical space to move the spatial position of a coupled digital object in digital space.

Reading as a process makes use of the eyes, our highest bandwidth interface to the physical world. Light reflected from paper enters our eyes and hits their retinas where the light signals are converted to neural signals that are interpreted by the brain. The order and spatial relation of the symbols are then interpreted to perceive language, which is finally converted into mental contents.

Human's have best overcome this dilemma by using spoken language which gave them the faculty to share detailed information about the physical environment to each other.

Essentially, mental contents, or thoughts if you will, would be uploaded and saved on remote servers much like any other form of digital data is today. As mentioned, this would be advantageous because digital information is space efficient, resistant to atrophy, mutable-friendly, and has lower transfer latency. You may recognize that storing information in books offered similar benefits, so you might wonder why this is a better solution. Simply put, with all one's mental contents saved on the cloud, one would essentially have a memory extension that they can use to upload and download \"thoughts\" to one's brain. This relationship is similar to how one might download digital information from the cloud onto their physical computer's hard disk. Additionally, one isn't limited to accessing their information alone; they'd be able to acquire any and all information from the internet. The implications of these two improvements means that humans would be able to speak to each other instantly and free of subjectivity due to minimized information loss caused by translation error inherent in language.

What such an intervention would do is simply delegate control of this iterative process to humans and allow us to perform it over shorter timescales. Recall that humans today are in no way an optimal design. Another benefit that comes with taking control of this iterative process is that we will now be able to reconcile nature's original objective function with our higher-level needs: love, esteem, and self-actualization. Thus, collectively we will be closer to achieving self-actualization and every need below it on the Hierarchy of Needs."

The brain-computer interface would undeniably be classified as one of humanity's greatest inventions; to have widespread acceptance and adoption of such a technology would mean a shift in the resistance to radical technological advancements. I've already elaborated on how instantaneous communication, instantaneous knowledge acquisition, and a persistent remote knowledge repository would save us all significant amounts of time. There would be little use for formal learning institutions, and all humans would individually have direct access and understanding of all human knowledge. As a civilization, we would undergo an exponential growth in knowledge purely on the basis that more people would devote more time to tackling humanity's toughest problems. More intelligent people also means more intelligent solutions for collectively satisfying our collective Hierarchy of Needs.

We are biological machines in a complex environment running greedy algorithms with the hopes of finding an optimal solution for ourselves as opposed to finding a globally optimal solution. I mean, for most of history it only made sense for civilization to organize itself this way. It was efficient. If everyone specialized and devoted their time to a single resource, collectively as a society we would be able to make more resources and as a result of more resources, more needs would be satisfied overall. With the use of representative money within the resource exchange system, any mutual trade could be made. But as I mentioned previously, such a society also bread a culture of ownership, spoiled by the hoarding and overconsumption of resources. In such a society sharing makes no sense, and because of its zero-sum nature, many suffer as a result. However, I think we've reached point in our history where we could be freed of the consequences of scarcity.

In spite of this reality, I think it is foolish to resist this increased automation in the long term. Let's think about this using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as an aid. All humans have to fulfill a set of basic needs to survive. These include, but are not limited to, food, water, warmth, rest, shelter and security. Throughout history humans have had to spend time finding ways to satiate these needs, and we got really good at it. The only issue: humans still have to devote time to collecting and producing the resources to sustain these needs. It might not be all of us, but there are a sizable group of people still invested in this business. Enter automation: we have created robots and machines that are far better than us at performing routine tasks, work at faster rates than us, and are not afflicted with the need to rest, so they can work night and day. These robots represent a threat to the jobs of many denizens, but they also offer the opportunity for humanity to be liberated from the need to occupy our time fulfilling these basic needs. If fully embraced and used to automate all processes associated with basic needs, machines could be delegated lower level jobs while us humans could occupy our time fulfilling higher level needs such as love, esteem, and self-actualization."

Nonetheless, I want to express that I don't think this process will be effortless. We have been entrenched in a capitalist society for quite some time now, and our minds have been conditioned to this societal system. In fact, the brain-computer interface might even be an easier problem given it is purely technical, while the post-scarcity problem involves imperfect entities. The vision might seem overly ambitious, but isolated areas of society already function in this way: libraries are governed by a culture of shared resources used on-demand — the same can be said of the internet. We're even witnessing in real-time a shift in the automotive industry from human-driven and distinctly-owned automobiles to the adoption of <Link src={'https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux'} text={'shared autonomously-driven electric automobile fleets'} />, similar to those mentioned in my visioning exercise. This eventual shift will result in better utilization of city space due to a lower need for parking space, less accidents on the road, better utilization and reduction of commute time, and cleaner transportation systems. There's also been talks of instating a policy called <Bold text={'<Link src={'https://futurism.com/images/universal-basic-income-answer-automation/'} text={'Universal Basic Income'} />'} /> (UBI). Briefly, UBI is a form of social security in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere. It sounds like an outlandish idea, but there's been serious considerations made by countries worldwide to implement or test such a system. In fact, some countries, such as <Link src={'https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/03/finland-experiments-universal-basic-income.html'} text={'Finland'} />, are already experimenting with it. However while I am a proponent for the utilization of UBI, I see it as an intermediary to a more radical economic system such as the resource-based economy mentioned in '<Link src={'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb5ivvcTvRQ'} text={'The Choice Is Ours'} />' documentary above."

A lot of today's youth make use of the Internet as a medium of communication and information retrieval; because so many people are connected to the internet, I believe it can be used as an effective way disseminate information. As a user of the Internet, its problem lies in the fact that it is so vast, which makes it difficult to acquire concise and relevant information. What I propose is an all-in-one website dedicated to technology with relevance to South Africa – a page where young people can visit to learn about the latest technologies and how they can improve our standards of living, to read inspirational stories about people our age performing great feats, to be exposed to interesting websites and hobbyist projects (such as the <Link src={'http://arduino.cc/'} text={'Arduino'} />), and get a sense of where the technological world is heading. The website has to take advantage of other social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, to get people talking and to connect more people to the page.

Similarly, because they've lost interest in the subjects, they tend to find the work difficult because they don't have an interest in applying themselves to it. With this website I want to re-brand mathematics and sciences to the youth as tools with which they can reshape our landscape.

The teaching methods at schools and universities are very theoretically based, so students hardly get practical experience until later in their studies. I've noticed the consequences of this at the University of Cape Town this year, where I've seen that very few people who have chosen engineering as a profession have been exposed to actual electronics, and consequently find it difficult to cope with it, as a subject. Furthermore, I've noted many people who have chosen engineering as a profession, realize only late into their studies that they don't enjoy it because they had never been exposed to it, in their lives, before. These people often leave engineering to rather apply their analytical skills in business management roles. The converse might also happen, where people who have never been exposed to engineering possibly could have enjoyed it and even excelled in the discipline, but never had the chance to because they were not exposed to it."

To resolve this, I could film the workshops and broadcast them on the previously proposed website with a list of the items needed to complete projects. Through this, more people will be exposed to true engineering – which might encourage people to engage in mathematics and science – assisted to cultivate the relevant skills, and helped to make more informed decisions about choosing engineering as a potential profession.

The exchange programs could help to expose more students and lecturers to the methods of teaching used elsewhere to help improve the methods we currently use here. The foundation could possibly be involved with Eskom, particularly in its Expo for Young Scientists, where it could identify new talent and help guide them. By going to MIT, I will also be opening up networking possibilities for both students and lecturers alike in South Africa; from these, I could possibly facilitate in organizing mentorship opportunities between scholars from there and from our universities. This foundation could visit different schools and conduct talks directed at the younger grades, such as Grade 9, and expose them to the \"mysterious\" field of engineering.

Through providing many avenues with which to practically apply knowledge, the initiatives will develop creative minds and aid in producing qualified engineers. Having more engineers who are passionate about creating will not only boosts our manufacturing sector, but will potentially expedite solutions to South Africa's and the African continent's biggest problems, through the use of technology. As a bonus, it is likely more people will open up their own businesses – \"start-ups\" – to market their new ideas, which could aid in alleviating our poverty problem. I believe that through these tactical strategies, South Africa will be well on its way to becoming a producer as opposed to just being the consumer, and will be in a better position to solving its current economic and social problems."

This question has been explored by many notable figures, but it's by looking at the work of makers and writers from the last handful of centuries that we get a sense of how the views of the mind have evolved. Deserving mention, Swiss maker <Italic text={'Pierre Jacquet-Droz'} />, who in an attempt to replicate being, created a \"life-sized and lifelike figure of a boy seated at a desk, capable of writing up forty letters\", and another figure \"in the shape of a boy\" that could \"draw up to four different sketches\". These machines attempted to replicate 'being' through imitation of action, but they lacked evidence of the defining quality of being - thought. Nonetheless, these machines still the made people question whether humans had the ability to \"breath life\" into what they created. Of more interest to us is the literature written during this period and its interpretation of the man-machine relationship. <Italic text={'Mazlish'} />, Professor Emeritus in the Department of History at <Italic text={'Massachusetts Institute of Technology'} />, in a paper about the history of the mind-machine relationship mentions five notable works of literature written during this period that deal with the aforementioned relationship; by analyzing them its easy to see that the imitation of action was initially sufficient enough to warrant discussion about sentient machines. Later, this moved to the requirement of flesh, blood, and reproduction capabilities. However, these are traits shared by most animals, and aren't necessarily indications of being, especially if one doesn't believe animals are capable of thought. In the cases above, human-like appearances and motions were associated with the possession of consciousness, but as Descartes noted, and as scholars came to realize, being lies in thought. In particular, study of the mind has suggested that thought originates in the brain. With this understanding, coupled with the advent of technological breakthroughs, we have seen the robot take the place of the figures mentioned above in modern literature. The robot represents a departure from representing being through anatomical imitation, and focuses on behavioral and thought imitation.  This behavioral imitation comes in the form of artificial intelligence, which lacks a body, but attempts to replicate human thought."

The movie explores this relationship, with a particular focus on love and life, but in the process presents to the audience what the writer and most scholars of our time believe characterize thought.

In one line Samantha states, \"I don't have a body; I live in a computer\"; in this sentence, the computer is seen as a vessel for the mind.

This can be summarized as: selfhood, the ability to pick up intonation cues, the ability to exercise creativity, the capability to feel, and the ability to grow through experiences. Although the film functions primarily as a piece of art, it simultaneously functions as a source detailing contemporary views on the mind-machine relationship. These views have become more refined over the years; however, I do find it interesting to note that Descartes views continue to be the foundation on which contemporary ideas of the mind are being built. It will be interesting to see where these views eventually build."

Angular 2 switched it up a bit because people found the Angular directives confusing, so now it's <Code text={'ngFor=\"let item of items\"'} />.",

This method of integration is convenient because it allows developers to define those tree structures inherent to the <Italic text={'DOM'} /> within their <Italic text={'JavaScript'} /> code. As a result, your <Italic text={'HTML'} /> markup is able to leverage the power of <Italic text={'JavaScript'} />, giving you more flexibility and control.

If you imagine your application as a tree structure, components higher in the tree (parent components) can pass down their state variables and methods to child components.

This state would be passed down to both child elements as <Italic text={'props'} /> – the light switch would, in addition to the state, receive a toggle method (<Code text={'this.toggleSwitch'} />) to mutate the value of the <Italic text={'App'} /> state variable when the switch is clicked. This method would be tied to the switch as an event handler and respond to any click events on the light switch. As a result, when a user clicks the switch (an event), the <Code text={'this.props.toggleSwitch()'} /> method would be called by the event handler. This is an example of events triggering up the application. The method would then be invoked, toggling the switch state from \"off\" (false) to \"on\" (true), which in turn would be passed down to both child elements. The lightbulb would act on this new state by automatically re-rendering to the \"light on\" state, while the switch would act by automatically re-rendering to the \"pressed in\" state.
